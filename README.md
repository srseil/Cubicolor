# Cubicolor

Cubicolor is a minimalist puzzle game. The rules are simple: Match the color patches on the board and reach the exit, all on one single path. The game gets harder as the levels progress, always accompanying you with soothing piano tunes.

**Note:** This repository represents an older version (v1.1) of the game, implemented in Java using the libGDX game development framework.
The game was later re-implemented in the Godot engine.
